# Text Summarizer Using NLP

This project is focused on the development and deployment of an NLP-based text summarizer application. The application provides a user-friendly interface to input text and receive a concise summary generated automatically by the underlying NLP model.

## Project Overview

The Text Summarizer application is designed to help users quickly understand the gist of large text documents by providing a summary of key points. Utilizing state-of-the-art NLP techniques, the application processes the input text and extracts the most relevant sentences to construct a coherent summary.

## Technical Architecture

The application is built using a Flask web framework and deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. The deployment pipeline is automated with AWS CodePipeline, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.

### NLP Model

- **Tokenization**: Breaks down the text into sentences and words.
- **Sentence Scoring**: Each sentence is scored based on word frequency.
- **Summary Generation**: Sentences with the highest scores are selected to create a summary.

### Deployment

- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Manages application deployment, from capacity provisioning and load balancing to auto-scaling and application health monitoring.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Automates the software release process, enabling fast and reliable updates.

## Development Process

1. **NLP Model Development**: The NLP model was trained and tested locally to ensure high accuracy and performance.
2. **Flask Application**: A Flask application was created as an interface for the NLP model.
3. **AWS Deployment**: The application was containerized and deployed using Elastic Beanstalk. The deployment pipeline was configured with AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD.

## Usage

To use the text summarizer, the user submits a text through the web interface. The application processes the text and displays the summary in real-time.

## Future Work

- **Model Improvement**: Implement advanced NLP techniques and models such as BERT or GPT-3 for better summarization.
- **Feature Expansion**: Add features like bulk upload, language translation, and user account integration.

## Conclusion

The Text Summarizer application demonstrates the successful integration of modern NLP techniques in a user-friendly tool. Its deployment on AWS ensures scalability and reliability, with the potential for future enhancements and additional features.
